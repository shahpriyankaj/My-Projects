Hello, B-W-A. I thank you all for that warm welcome. There’s nowhere I’d rather be than right here with all of you this morning.

Please everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years — your organizations, individually — and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I’ve been privileged to do.

I want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it’s always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting.

I want to congratulate today’s honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.

And I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, ‘Well, you are coming, aren’t you?’ And I said, ‘I’m working hard to get it set.’ And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.

I also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines — everyone associated with The Black Women’s Agenda, I’m thrilled to be with you. I’m thrilled to be associated with you. I’m also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women’s health.

Looking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor’s orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home — that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.

And you, your daughters, your granddaughters — I was pleased to meet Gwen’s beautiful granddaughter earlier — leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books — make no mistake — you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real.

Now, I’ve been blessed to see this magic’s influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children’s Defense Fund. Marian’s belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn’t afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn’t have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart.

But Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically– to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren’t in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn’t because schools weren’t accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that.

We gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I’m here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I’m here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge — three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days.

It goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It’s past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let’s be clear: I would not be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign — who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We’ve come far together.

And as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I’m going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children’s Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against.

And together — together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.

We’re going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.

We’ll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we’ll make universal pre-k available so that every child — no matter what they look like or where they live — can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.

We are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!

We’ll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we’re going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.

We are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn’s ‘10-20-30’ plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.

We’ll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe.

We’ll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child’s life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at dinner. We’ll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity.

And we’re going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We’ll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected – civil rights and women’s rights, LGBT rights, worker’s rights and, of course, voting rights.

We are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn’t it? That’s because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance.

On one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he’s tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, ‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’ And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history.

Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald’s advisors had the temerity to say, ‘He’s doing the country a ‘service’ by pushing these lies.’ No, he isn’t. He’s feeding into the worst impulses — the bigotry and bias — that lurks in our country.

Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no ‘new’ Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn’t see him as an American.

Think of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go – no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn’t look like him, and doesn’t agree with him, and thinks, ‘That person must not be a real American.’

Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can’t just accept this.We’ve got to stand up to it. If we don’t, it won’t stop.

In addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it’s time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.

That’s why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, ‘When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn’t between a Democrat or Republican.’ It’s about who will have the power to shape our children’s lives for the next four years. It’s also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations.

We are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation’s promise, contribute to its progress. ‘Stronger Together’ is not just our campaign slogan. It’s the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?

Now in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.

Keep up the great work with your Four for 4’ campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, ‘I just — I don’t know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.’

Well, here’s what we can do. Let’s reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this … to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.

With our power and strength, I know — I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the incoming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you. I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and – I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.

Before I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.

I’m here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future – the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America. I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley. A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia. She loves Temple and we love her. And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction.

Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future. Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we’ve ever seen. And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus – so she started one. And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.

Now, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical – especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing’s ever going to change. But you’re here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change – but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.

You’re here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You’re also here because you know this election isn’t a reality TV show. It shouldn’t be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.

This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it’s wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It’s wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it’s wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe.

It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?

I know what I believe, and I’m going to close my campaign the same way I started my career – fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you’ll join me. We can’t get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors – getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn’t matter, you forget what’s really important to your future and to the future of this country.

Take the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you’re willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that’s been out of reach for too many young people – trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That’s why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.

Next, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.

So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you’re never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.

And here’s something we don’t talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we’re offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board – for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.

Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today’s economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.

That’s why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe – the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.

Everywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren’t – and you shouldn’t be – satisfied with the progress we’ve made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.

But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we’ve never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America’s best days are ahead of us. In large part, that’s because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.

I’m inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she’s in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this.

I’m inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who’ve done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York – and I can recommend, it’s delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.

I’m inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I’ve ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It’s been painful for her – a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful – but Erica won’t give up. As she said, ‘What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it’s hard, so I’m going to walk away? That’s not the type of world I want to live in.’

That’s the spirit that makes this country great – we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that’s the spirit we need in this election too.

Now, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you’re totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.

When it comes to public service, the ‘service’ part has always easier for me than the ‘public’ part. I will never be the showman my opponent is – and you know what, that’s okay with me. And it’s also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that’s because it’s not a detail for you. It’s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.

So here’s what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can’t promise you’ll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We’re not keeping it a secret. We’ve got a book called ‘Stronger Together.’

But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.

The first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here’s what she said, one word: ‘kindness.’ She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.

That mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there’s always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.

When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.

The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children’s Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer – we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I’d learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, ‘Could I work for you this summer?’ She said, ‘Sure, but I can’t pay you.’ I said, ‘Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.’ She said, ‘Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.’ So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.

After graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children’s Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn’t seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn’t force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.

I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn’t about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today.  

The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn’t run for anything since student council. I’d always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, ‘Dare to compete.’ Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, ‘Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.’ Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?

Well, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don’t enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I’m running now, to even the odds for those who’ve got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I’ve learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.

Now, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be downright depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he’s still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.

And when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It’s going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That’s why, if I’m in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.

So if you believe diversity is America’s strength, not America’s burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.

And here’s how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends. Register everyone you know. This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines. Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump’s hands. It really does. Text ‘join,’ j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. I understand here at Temple you’re already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it. We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election – that’s just the first step – then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we’re going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are. So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.

You know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I’ve learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate.  

So please join us in working together. There’s no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they’re from, what they look like, or who they love. That’s the America we believe in. That’s the America worth fighting for. That’s what we’ve got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let’s make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!

Hello. It’s so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.

And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, President Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don’t think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he’s done on behalf of our country and the world. And it’s not just the President he’s been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, ‘When others go low, we go high.’ I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you’re a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.

Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps – Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.

This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund all those years ago. And I’m going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.

We have so much work to do together. I’ve heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she’d been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let’s prove her right.

As a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what’s at stake in this election. It’s not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down to who will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.

We need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can’t let Barack Obama’s legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn’t understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn’s 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.
When you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it’s about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It’s also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I’m not taking your vote or anyone’s vote for granted. I’m working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.
Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you’re doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let’s send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!

Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone – especially Val Demings. Where’s Val? Val – I know – got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.

I want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn’t she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, ‘My twin sister can’t speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she’s very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.’ I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl – her confidence and how much she loved her sister.

So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I’m very excited that she’s here with us today.

I also want to thank Orlando. It’s great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You’ve been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you’ve responded with grace. You’ve shown the world what Orlando is made of – strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now.

I’m here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I’m sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.

There is still much we don’t know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It’s unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.

We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott’s death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I’ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.

I’ve also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country’s concerned, their lives seem disposable. We’ve got to do better. And I know we can. And if I’m elected president, we will – and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.

Look, I know I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn’t have.

Sybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, ‘This is about saving our children.’ And she’s absolutely right. We need to come together, work together – white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us – to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.

Now, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that’s why we’re here today. Because in just 48 days – can you believe it, 48 days – Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it’s our job to make sure it’s there for you and future generations.

Building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I’m a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.

Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us – our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth – when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.

Now, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women’s labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn’t as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it’s not fair to them – and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.

That’s one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It’s one reason why I’m such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that.

It’s also one reason why we’ve got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That’s part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it’s why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we’ve got to help older Americans who’ve displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy.

And too often, training and retraining doesn’t work as it should. If you don’t have a four-year degree, if you haven’t really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it’s hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you’re trying to start your career or you’ve spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.

Now, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I’m going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we’ve actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we’re asking you to support us, we should tell you what we’re going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn’t gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that’s been true for a long time, and we have to change it.

I’m talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We’ve got to face that and do better for everyone’s sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency.

I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don’t know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are.

Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They’re veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They’re working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.

And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they’re doing phenomenal work. I’m grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.

Now, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recognizing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability – if you couldn’t see, couldn’t walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue – that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn’t and never would. And that was that.

I saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children’s Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren’t in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there’d be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren’t they in school?

I went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren’t trained to help her. So she didn’t get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn’t going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren’t rich. They weren’t powerful. So what could they do about it?

That little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn’t face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood – abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn’t want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.

The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children’s Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.

So we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I’m proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.

As Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He’s had so many surgeries, we’ve lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and – for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he’s a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he’s just one of the most optimistic people you’ll ever meet.

Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.

I’ll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, ‘family values.’ ‘Since my accident,’ he said, ‘I’ve found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we’re all family and we all have value.’ I couldn’t agree more.

We’ve come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can’t be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren’t in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We’ve got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect.

Now, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, ‘We don’t want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.’ As president, I’m going to give – give them that chance. First, we’re going to focus on jobs and incomes. I’m going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn’t be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we’re going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.

Second, we’re going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let’s raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let’s make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It’s like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let’s make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.

Third, we’re going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we’ll launch a new effort we’re calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.

Fourth, let’s build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it’s a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.

Now, these ideas are just a start. We’re working with advocates to come up with even more. If you’ve got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart.

I’ve always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It’s how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.

Now, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It’s a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I’ve carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald’s. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then – then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she’d bring her family there on off days just to hang out.

Earlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn’t it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia’s former managers asked for everyone’s attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, ‘We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.’

My friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn’t that what we all want to hear? Isn’t that America at our best? We don’t thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one’s worthless, no one’s ‘less than.’ We’re all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate.

Thank you all.

Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what – what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.

And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.

I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn’t it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.

Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.

We’ve got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?

Now, as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate?

Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.

My opponent believes in what I call a ‘strongman approach.’ He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don’t see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here’s what he said. He said, ‘I alone can fix it.’ I alone?

Well, we have learned that that’s his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That’s why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that’s not how change happens in America. It’s never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us.

We see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.

How many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It’s one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don’t just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don’t get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.

This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.

People are starting to call out their services!

There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what’s so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it’s something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.

We’ve got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I’ll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They’re building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I’ll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here’s how it starts: ‘I will get things done for America.’ Isn’t that great? I think we should make that a national slogan.

Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they’re working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They’re tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I’m really grateful to them.

We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.

Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn’t it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.

And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It’s not just how we feel, they’ve actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It’s a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.

It’s easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that’s understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren’t many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that’s one of the reasons I think it’s so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.

I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy’s call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.’

But sometimes it’s hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that’s not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute.

So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn’t just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.

I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We’re not exceptional just because of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We’re exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.

Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, ‘What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?’ And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I’m elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here’s what I plan to do.

First, let’s triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It’s finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we’re going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.

Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can’t afford it. So let’s lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let’s keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.

Now second, let’s grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it’s given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it’s fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We’ve got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let’s make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.

Third, let’s expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let’s be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I’ve talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn’t just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn’t give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.

Now I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn’t something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let’s give people an encore opportunity after they’ve ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.

And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let’s do something like that in the civilian space. Let’s call it the National Service Reserve.

And here’s the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you’ll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.

And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won’t have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who’ve said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can’t leave their jobs, understandably. We’ll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.

I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There’s so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let’s bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.

Now, I don’t think you’ll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that’s a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what’s being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don’t usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, ‘Well hey, my gosh, you’ve only got 39 days to go. Why aren’t you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I’ll do that, but – I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I’m trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them.

Thank you!

For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: ‘Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.’ Now, I’ve carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it’s an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what’s kept me going are the people that I’ve met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can’t think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.

That’s why ‘Stronger Together’ is more than just a slogan. It’s a course of action. So here’s what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.

There are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I’ll tell you what side I’m going to be on, and with your help, we’re going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.

Thank you and God bless you!

This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!I am so […] and so honored to be here. Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker. Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion. I have to confess – we were putting together the […] Rev. Walker was […]But he told me his church […] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady […]I am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a […] path in the Congress, such a […] of conviction. And my thanks also to Donna […] for her leadership for that stirring description […] Thank you so much.
This church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and […] It has helped people get […]. It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come […] and it has […] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.
It has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don’t yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, ‘We do what each of us can do.’ Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.
Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.
And we also know — and we must not forget — that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.
It’s been a hard year, hasn’t it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You’ve seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, ‘I wake up every morning scared that I won’t get to grow up because I am black.’
A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who’s here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, ‘We are black people and we shouldn’t have to feel like this. It’s a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can’t even see them anymore. It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.’ What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.
But can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she’s talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what’s going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children’s eyes.
I’m a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn’t be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let’s be honest here – they won’t face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.
You know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We’ve got to take action, we’ve got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can’t solve all these problems over night, which means we don’t have a moment to lose.
Proverbs tells us, ‘Where there is no vision, the people perish.’ So let’s hold on to a common vision. Let’s come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they’re born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.
Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.
I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. ‘In uniform,’ he wrote, ‘I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don’t let hate infect your heart.’ And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, ‘I got you.’
Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can’t do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.
That starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.
Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We’ve got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn’s plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.
Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people’s fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more ‘law and order.’ As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn’t exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.
I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I’ve been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children’s Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it’s not just personal to so many of us, it’s about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?
I love your dress.
You know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It’s not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other’s children, each other’s dignity, each other’s opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You’ve been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God’s children is America’s calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: ‘Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.’ We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God’s people. Thank you.

Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.

And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there’s an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we’re so happy you’re here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world’s most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.

About a decade ago, Al made a movie called ‘An Inconvenient Truth.’ Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven’t, I hope you’ll watch it tonight. It doesn’t have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama.

And here’s the main message: climate change is real, it’s urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.

Now, let me just say – so, so let’s remember, let’s remember what’s at stake. I’m running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it’s a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore’s been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America’s efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people – in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.

Look at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.

So we’ve really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.

That’s why I’ve encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.

Now, some will say, ‘We’ve always had hurricanes. They’ve always been destructive.’ And that’s true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew’s storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.

Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It’s become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.

So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it’s costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let’s focus on what’s really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dad’s shoulders – are grandparents, we believe that’s more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it’s as much as $882 billion in property at risk.

But there’s also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.

And it’s also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America’s national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It’s the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it’s sunny. So that’s why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.

So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, ‘Ok, I agree, something’s happening here. We need to take it seriously.’

But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people – in Washington, on the campaign trail – who won’t face what’s happening right in front of us.

Donald Trump, is, quote, ‘not a big believer’ in climate change. As I said, he said it’s a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.

And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach’s Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these ‘Sunny Day’ Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemán. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she’s supporting our campaign—because she knows America can’t afford a candidate who doesn’t accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, ‘Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please, let’s come together as a country and do something about it.’

We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.

We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.

So here’s what I want to do.

First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us—and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.

And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.

Now, you wouldn’t know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn’t tell the story about what’s really going on. It’s actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.

And in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.

So this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let’s generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let’s make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.

And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.

We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I’m hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.

And while we do that, let’s make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let’s be more creative – like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we’ll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they’re trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.

And here’s something we don’t talk enough about. Let’s make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses – heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children’s Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.

And then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don’t do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There’s no doubt about that. And so, let’s move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.

When I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It’s called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.

And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn’t care what it would do to the planet. He doesn’t care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn’t care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.

Well, he may not care – but we do. And that’s why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It’s every issue we care about it’s our values as a country.

Climate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House.

And if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I’ll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, ‘I’m not a scientist.’ Well, why doesn’t he ask a scientist and then maybe then he’d understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That’s why I hope that you’ll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.

Look, we need leaders who can get results. It’s easy to stonewall. It’s not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don’t have a minute to waste.

So, I know it’s easy to get cynical—especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we’ve got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it’s so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.

And just look, if you will – look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words ‘climate change.’ So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn’t anybody – there isn’t anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can’t wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.

Al Gore

Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Secretary Clinton, and ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for the warm welcome. I appreciated those kind words very much. I want to acknowledge all of the elected officials and distinguished guests who are here, and I want to say a special word of thanks to President Eduardo Padrón and Miami Dade College. I understand you’ve got a pretty good women’s volleyball team here, so go Lady Sharks. Is that what you say?

I’m here today with two very simple messages. Number one, when it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world, the choice in this election is extremely clear. Hillary Clinton will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority. Very important. Her opponent, based on the ideas that he has presented, would take us toward a climate catastrophe. So that’s my first message: the climate crisis is and must be regarded as a top national priority and a top global priority.

Here is my second message: your vote really, really, really counts a lot. You can consider me as an Exhibit A of that truth. Now, for those of you younger – for those of you who are younger than 25, you might not remember the election of 2000 and what happened here in Florida and across the country. For those of you older than 25, I heard you murmuring just now. But take it from me, it was a very close election. Elections – well, here’s my point. Here’s my point. I don’t want you to be in a position years from now where you welcome Hillary Clinton and say, actually, you did win, it just wasn’t close enough to make sure that all the votes were counted or whatever.

Elections have consequences. Your vote counts. Your vote has consequences.

And in this election, the future of Miami and cities up and down the West Coast and East Coast of Florida are on the ballot as well. Indeed, the entire state of Florida and its future are on this ballot. So is our economy, our health, our national security. The common thread that binds all of these issues together: what we decide to do about carbon pollution and its damage to the ecological system of the Earth.

I don’t have to tell you here in Florida that the climate crisis is real. Yes, it’s true that some of your elected officials have not recognized that it’s real, but every single night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. You look at the floods and the droughts and the mudslides and the fires and the incredible downpours, and as Secretary Clinton just mentioned, Hurricane Matthew just recently. You know, it spun up from a tropical storm into a category five hurricane in just 36 hours. That’s extremely unusual. And the reason that happened is the climate crisis is trapping so much extra heat in the Earth’s system, equivalent to what would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs going off every day. It’s a big planet, but that’s a lot of energy, and it’s warming the oceans – more than 90 percent of that heat energy goes into the oceans.

And so the southern Caribbean, where it spun up into a category five so quickly, was much warmer than normal because of that; and the Gulf Stream is way warmer than normal for this time of year for the same reason.

So this means also that all the water vapor coming off the oceans into the atmosphere is brought over the land and so we get these record downpours. Just in the last year, we have seen one-in-a-thousand-year downpours in Louisiana, West Virginia, Texas, Maryland. In Houston, in one 12-month period, they’ve just had two 500-year floods and one 1,000-year downpour. In one of them, they had as much water dumped on Harris County, Texas, where Houston is, as would have been put there by three and a half days of the entire flow of Niagara Falls. This is not normal. It is becoming the new normal, which is now a set of conditions that we have created with all of this man-made global warming pollution.

Secretary Clinton also mentioned the sea level rise. We have seen already – some of you who are a little bit older may remember Hurricane Andrew, when – yeah, absolutely. When Hillary and I were first campaigning together in 1992, Hurricane Andrew came through. Just since Hurricane Andres, the sea level in the waters around Florida have gone up three inches since Hurricane Andrew. And every vertical inch of sea level rise means four to eight feet of the water going inward and the storm surges on top of that. And yes, there are now, at high tide, sometimes ocean – fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Delray and Fort Lauderdale. And the rainfall in Carolina is – Secretary Clinton mentioned what they’re still dealing with there. They got 17 inches of rain because the warmer oceans not only make the wind speed much stronger than it has been in the past on average, but it also dumps all of that water on the land.

And she mentioned the role it plays in health. Just yesterday, there were six more cases of Zika announced in Dade County, and the public health authorities are doing a great job and really wrestling with it, and these tropical diseases have spread so quickly partly because of airline travel and the transportation revolution. But the changing climate conditions change the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots. The mosquitos mature faster, and then the virus in the mosquito incubates much faster, and they bite more often because they’re cold-blooded and when the temperature goes up, their metabolism goes up, and they spread the disease way more quickly.

So these and many other consequences, including the fires out West that Secretary Clinton talked about, are really wakeup calls for us. Mother Nature is giving us a very clear and powerful message. We cannot continue putting 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every day as if it’s an open sewer. We’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to wake up and recognize the need for change.

So most people know that we have to change this, but here’s the really good news that more people should know. We can change this. We now have the ability to change this. It’s going to be a long, hard fight. We’ve got a long way to go. But we now have the renewable energy technologies and the efficiency improvements and electric vehicles and sustainable and organic agriculture and sustainable forestry and the other ways of changing our lives for the better that can sharply diminish the amount of global warming pollution that we’re putting up there. And Secretary Clinton is exactly right that we can create good jobs in the process, jobs that can’t be outsourced.

She’s also right that either China or Germany or some other country other than the U.S. could become the renewable energy superpower of this new century. One day last December, Germany, which is much higher in latitude than the U.S. and pretty cloudy at that – one day they got 87 percent of all their electricity from wind and solar and renewable energy. We can be on track to do that as well. And China – yes, China is the biggest polluter now, but they have begun to change big time. Their coal use is going down. Their overall emissions are going down. And they’ve just announced that this – next year, in 2017, they’re adopting a nationwide cap and trade program and they’re taking other measures to reduce and to create those jobs in China.

And in Paris – the Paris Agreement is a big deal. Yeah, it’s not enough. Yes, it needed to do more. But it is by far the biggest step forward the world has ever taken to solve the climate crisis. Every nation in the world, virtually – I think there were three or four little ones like maybe Nicaragua or something like that who didn’t – but virtually every nation in the world agreed to phase out these greenhouse gas emissions and go to net-zero emissions early in the second half of this century, and to begin that process now. And it sent a powerful signal to businesses and industries and investors. And I can tell you, that signal is being received. We hear news every single day of more businesses making that shift.

So the question in this election, and this comes back to my first message, is which of these candidates is going to continue the progress and actually increase the rate of progress? With Hillary Clinton, we’ll build on the progress made under President Obama with the Paris Agreement and she will seize the opportunities. After all, solar electricity and wind electricity is now way cheaper than it was years ago when some of us started sounding the alarm about this crisis.

Hillary Clinton knows this very well, and she’s worked with President Obama. Since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the cost of wind electricity has come down by half. Solar is down by 64 percent. LED is down by 94 percent. We have seen – we’ve seen electricity from solar increase 30 times over. Last year in the entire United States in the calendar year 2015, if you look at all of the new electricity generation that was added in the U.S. last year, what percentage of it do you think was solar and wind? Seventy-one percent, virtually zero from coal. And it’s already – it’s already creating millions of jobs and it continues to get cheaper and cheaper every single week. World records are being broken every month now as it continues to get cheaper.

Now, Hillary Clinton knows this not only because she has studied it and – not only because she’s worked with President Obama, but her work in the Senate emphasized this. Her work on child asthma and air pollution and helping to improve children’s health by cutting down on air pollution was very important. Her work on environmental justice, helping call attention to the fact that it’s the poor people and minority communities and people of color who are almost always victimized more than the rest of us on – by these environmental crises.

And she has proposed a terrific plan to install – well, she said it herself and I’m not going to repeat all of it, but I’ll just say this. When she put out her solar plan – a half a billion solar panels by the end of her first term and enough renewable energy to power every home in America – I looked at that plan very carefully. And I will say to all of you, you will hear a lot of candidates for office who will put out plans that have words you’re not even sure what they might mean because the words – there are ways to put things. I went through that with a fine-tooth comb, and I will tell you that her plan on solar panels and expanding renewable energy – it is right at the limit of what we can do, and that is exactly the kind of ambitious goal that we need from the next president of the United States of America.

Almost 100 years ago, America’s most famous inventor, Thomas Edison, said these words – it’s an exact quote: ‘I would put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power. I hope we don’t have to wait until the oil and coal come out before we tackle that.’

Now, I want to say a brief word – I’m going to return to my second main point here in a minute, but I want to say a brief word about something else that all of you can do. You can elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate instead of a climate denier. But here’s something else you can do. Vote ‘no’ on Initiative 1 on your ballot.

Hillary mentioned that there are fewer solar jobs in the Sunshine State, Florida, than there are in New Jersey. Actually, Florida also lags behind Massachusetts, which is even farther north. Despite having three times the population of Massachusetts, Florida has less than half of the solar jobs that have been created in Massachusetts. Massachusetts installed more solar energy last year alone than Florida has installed in its entire history.

And one – yes, it’s ridiculous. That’s exactly right. And the head of one of the fossil-fuel-burning utilities here actually said last year, ‘Well, yes, Florida’s the Sunshine State, but remember, it’s also the partly cloudy state.’ Well, they are trying to cloud the truth by putting forward a phony-bologna initiative that sounds like it protects solar. It doesn’t protect solar. What – the things they claim protect solar are protections you already have. But they trying to fool you into amending your state constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering and do in Florida what they did in Nevada and just kill the solar industry.

Now, this is a question – Our democracy has been hacked and the utilities – the fossil utilities here have spent more than $20 million to try to pull the wool your eyes. And $20 million can buy a lot of wool. So Amendment 1 would benefit the incumbent fossil fuel companies here in Florida by making it harder for homeowners to go solar.

Now, let me close by returning to my second message. The stakes in this election simply could not be higher. You will often hear people from podiums like this one say something like that at election time. I know; I’ve heard it. I’ve even said it before. But honestly, to those of you here and those within the – who can hear my voice by whatever means, this election really matters. The world is on the cusp of either building on the progress and solving the climate crisis, or stepping back, washing our hands of America’s traditional role as the leader of the world and letting the big polluters call the shots.

The choice is that clear. It’s that stark. The consequences for not just our children and grandchildren and future generations, but for all of us, are really quite significant. So because of that, please take it from me: Every single vote counts. Every single vote counts. If you are not registered to vote, do so today. If you are on the fence about whether to vote, remember what is at stake in this election. And if you think your vote does not matter, take it from me, your vote can make all of the difference in this election.

Vote early. Vote early and don’t let your friends sit this election out. Early voting begins here in Dade County on October 24th and in several other parts of Florida it begins on October 24th. If you have any confusion whatsoever about where you vote or whether you’re registered or whether you are going to the right polling place, visit iwillvote.com – iwillvote.com. Say it with me: iwillvote.com. One more time. Iwillvote.com.

Now, if you want to be really in touch with this election process and get really involved in taking other people to the polls, there’s a –if you like to text, then text ‘climate’ – the word ‘climate’ – to this number – 47246 – and you’ll get updates. You’ll get the information you need. And then even on Election Day you’ll get updates on your polling place. So remember, text ‘climate’ to 47246. Say it with me: 47246.

All right. Now, in closing, I’ve made two points. The climate crisis must be a top priority. We must have a president who gets it, who cares about it, who’s internalized it, who’s passionate about it, who’s determined to lead our country, and with our country to lead the world at the key moment when we really do have the opportunity to solve this climate crisis and make our country stronger and more prosperous at the same time.

My second message is – you know what it is – every vote counts. That’s why I am here and that’s why I will vote for Hillary Clinton. I know that my vote counts. I know that your vote counts. I hope you will consider carefully the future in making your decision this November or beginning when early voting starts when you go into the ballot box.

Together, we have the opportunity to look back on this year as a time when our nation finally chose to answer the alarm bells on the climate crisis and went into action to solve it. I know that there are still some who doubt in their hearts that we as human beings and we as Americans have the ability to bring about such a big and important change. Do we have the capacity? I’ll remind you that the will to change and build a brighter future is itself a renewable resource. Let’s make Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States of America.

Hey, good afternoon, Detroit. How about a round of applause for Jejuan? What a great example for us. I am so happy to be with you. Thank you, Detroiters. Thank you, Michiganders. You guys are important, and it is so exciting to be here at Focus: HOPE. And I’ve got a great guest with me, my wife, Anne Holton, who is a–magnificent, magnificent public servant in her own right. My wife, Anne, was a legal aid lawyer and a juvenile court judge, and then when I was governor she helped me reform the Virginia foster care system, or I guess I should say I assigned staff to help her reform the Virginia foster care system, if I’m going to be honest. And she just stepped down as secretary of education because she wanted to be all in and make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States.

I had a chance to visit with the CEO here at Focus: HOPE, Jason Lee. Give Jason and everybody at Focus: HOPE a big round of applause. And I am particularly excited to be here with some great friends in public service, and let me just acknowledge a couple of them. I serve in the Senate with your two great senators, Gary Peters–I was with his wife Colleen a little bit earlier today–but Debbie Stabenow right here is a wonderful, wonderful friend. And she’s been very important to Project HOPE through the ag committee that she has chaired or been ranking member of because of the senior meal program in the farm bill. And so she’s very connected here. We’ve got Congressman Sandy Levin, and I was with – Sandy, I was with your brother, Carl, a few minutes ago. Very good to have Sandy here with us. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Have I seen Debbie? I see John right here, who is a titan and a champion. And there’s Debbie coming right in. Thank you. Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence. I was with Brenda earlier, and I think she might be here as well, but I just want to acknowledge her. And then your mayor, Mike Duggan, who I had a chance to visit with a little bit. Mike, thanks so much. Former Governor Jim Blanchard, who I’ve known for a number of years–Jim and Janet. And then, when I was a mayor, when I was the mayor of Richmond, the head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Dennis Archer. Mr. Mayor, so good to have you here too. So good to have you here.

This has been a surreal campaign. I will say, I have been–this is my ninth race, and because I was national party chair I worked on a lot of races. This has been by far the most surreal race I’ve ever seen, and I’m in the middle of it. And one of the things that sometimes is sad in a campaign that’s surreal is the things that get attention aren’t necessarily the things that are really important. But I’m really happy to be here today, I’m really happy to be here at Focus: HOPE, because I want to talk about something that’s really important, and that is what we can do, what a Hillary Clinton administration will do, to battle poverty in the United States. That is really important. It’s a lot more important than a lot of things that are getting a lot of attention during this campaign.

And we wanted to do it here at Focus: HOPE because this place has got a powerful history. You heard Jejuan is an example of the history, but what an amazing history. Fifty years ago, at a time when this neighborhood was marked by racial tensions and challenges, a local parish priest decided to step up and do something about it. Father William Cunningham, I’ve heard his story: he stepped outside the doors of the church and he partnered with Eleanor Josaitis, who was a mother and activist from suburban Detroit, and they founded Focus: HOPE to address poverty and injustice in struggling neighborhoods.

I have so much respect for this organization and for the hundreds and thousands of other organizations like it all across this country. We see this example of the local initiative–can we tackle a problem and solve a problem? And just since these guys had a spiritual motivation, I’ll go there a few times today. It’s kind of a loaves-and-fishes story. When they started, did they know they would be even going a week later? No. Did they know they’d be going a year later? No. But here they are 50 years later and Focus: HOPE is doing so much good for so many people. You set the right example. You set the right example.

And because this is a momentous time in America and we’re in a momentous election, and it’s an election that is more than just the difference between candidates, although those differences are so stark–this is an election that’s really a test of our values. This is an election that’s a test of our commitment to one another. I have described this as an election that is an America looking in the mirror and deciding what is it that we see there election. It’s a self-definition election, and not every election is that.

I’m really honored to serve as Hillary Clinton’s running mate, because she cares deeply, as do I, as do all of you, about making sure that the economy works for everybody and not just for those at the top. And when an economy works for everybody, it works for everybody, including those at the top; but if it doesn’t work for everybody, it just doesn’t work at all.

Hillary and I have a plan for creating jobs and opportunity across the board, and I’m going to talk about some of the elements in that plan, but with a focus. The focus on the commitment that we have and that was in the Democratic Party platform to work toward eliminating poverty in the United States.

We shouldn’t be afraid to dream big. We shouldn’t be afraid to reach far. We shouldn’t be afraid to say something bold and then have people hold us accountable for trying to do it. Because when Hillary and I talk about creating an economy that works for everybody, we really do mean everyone. And that includes Americans living near or below the poverty line. Some have lived near or below the poverty line their entire lives. Some, for generations. And some were above the poverty line but the recession that we’ve been through has dropped people down into poverty. What can we do?

If we’re fortunate enough to have the opportunity to serve as your president and vice president, we’ll need your help–in Detroit, in Michigan, all across this country. I see great folks from organized labor here. We’ll need your help. Because what you do here exemplifies the kinds of ideas and strategies that we’ll want to implement all across the country.

Okay, let’s start with what you’ve got to start with. You know, in a 12-step program, the first step is acknowledge you have a problem. If we’re going to fight poverty, you first have to see it and acknowledge it and talk about it openly and honestly. You know that here in Detroit. As the auto industry has come strongly back to life, the amazing city is showing an amazing comeback spirit, but you’re just getting started. And I know I had a chance to visit with Mike earlier, your great mayor. Him, the city government, the business community, organized labor: there’s a commitment to work together on economic revitalization and renaissance and until that reaches every neighborhood. But like so many great cities, like Richmond where I live, like Kansas City where I grew up, Detroit still faces the challenges of concentrated poverty. And you’re on the front lines in trying to come up with the solutions to tackle it.

Of course, you’ve got to acknowledge poverty isn’t just confined to cities, and it’s not only in the places that we normally think of, like isolated parts of Appalachia–Anne’s family is from the Appalachian part of Virginia–or rural America or Indian country. No, a lot of people live in poverty in places that we think of as comfortable and as doing fine. Twenty percent of the people in Taylor, near here, are living in poverty. And that’s a number that’s well above the national average. In a lot of communities, poverty is hiding in plain sight. And wherever it is, and however it looks, we’ve got to challenge ourselves to tackle it. We’ve got to open it up and see it for what it is.

I grew up in Kansas City, a town with its share of economic struggles. My dad ran an ironworker-organized welding shop with a lot of the machines just like I’m looking at back here, lathes and presses and punches and welding rigs. I lived and worked as a civil rights lawyer in Richmond for 32 years. Richmond, a city with some pain and some scar tissue. Seen a lot of progress but also too many people and too many neighborhoods left behind who still feel like they can’t see the ladder that they can climb to be successful.

Like the founders of Focus: HOPE, I don’t just look at this issue as a matter of justice or economics or public policies. I look at is as a moral issue. I look at it from a faith perspective. We all have our own traditions, and we can learn from each other’s traditions and get better. Jesus spoke more about the poor than just about any other topic, probably more than any other topic. He comes back to it in Scripture again and again to drive home the central teaching that serving the poor is among the most important things we do. […] traditions teach essentially the same thing, that if we don’t have a conscience and a heart that can be pricked and opened and challenged and we can’t respond to people in need, then we are not all that a human being should be.

Hillary Clinton grew up in a Methodist youth group with a pastor who took her to see Martin Luther King when she was a kid growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, and that opened her eyes to the challenges in the world. And I grew up in an Irish Catholic household, but we share this belief. We’ve got some Irish Catholics here. I already see the shout-out from the Irish Catholic section. That’s great. The teachings that my parents exposed me to and my church made a deep impression upon me as a young man educated at a Jesuit high school in Kansas City. They led me to interrupt my time teaching–I’m sorry, interrupt my time in law school to go be a teacher, volunteering with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras to teach carpentry and welding. And I saw families and kids living in some of the most abject poverty you can imagine. There was poverty a few miles away from me growing up that I never saw, and then I moved countries away to see it, but once you see it, wherever you see it–it can be in your neighborhood, it can be halfway across the world–it changes your attitude. And like Father Cunningham and Eleanor did here when they started Focus: HOPE, I used the skills that I got in my dad’s ironworking shop to help train others to support themselves.

That commitment from working with these great missionaries to reducing poverty drove me to become a civil rights lawyer in Richmond. I fought housing discrimination–people who had been turned away from housing either because of their skin color or their disability. And I petitioned the city council to approve a homeless shelter in a neighborhood where people needed a safe place to sleep and get back on their feet. Battling in my time in Richmond, my first years there, for civil rights and to end homelessness led me to do something that was absolutely unthinkable: run for the Richmond city council. […] I remember when I told Anne’s dad I was doing that […], and Anne’s dad was the first elected Republican governor of Virginia–’Lin, guess what, I’m running for the Richmond city council.’ He said, ‘Why in the hell would you want to do something like that?’

Well, I did it. I won my first race by 97 votes. That was nine races and 22 years ago. And throughout my time as a councilman, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and now Senator, in a commonwealth with both real poverty and real affluence, I saw how our economy grew and changed and I saw how all Virginians benefit when everybody had a fair shot at success. But I also saw that even as we benefited on average with the median income going up on average, or an unemployment rate going down on average, there are pockets all around my state where the average doesn’t tell the story because people in particular ZIP codes or people who were trained in particular industries, they don’t see the ladder that they can climb to success.

So fighting poverty has been the important cause of my life, and Anne is right there with me, and it’s an important cause in this campaign. And here’s some good news to start with. We have so much more to do, but some good news. The Census Bureau found that there were 3.5 million fewer people living in poverty in 2015 than in 2014, and it was one of the greatest changes in a single year ever in our history. And I don’t think President Obama gets enough credit–credit that he deserves–for the progress that he’s made. Because remember, and I know our congressional members and others–President Obama came in in the midst of the worst recession since the 1930s, and he’s had to do an awful lot with one complete side of Congress hardly lifting a finger to help him. And that achievement is something that we should be proud of him for.

But if President Obama were here, he’d be the first to remind us, even with that change–that’s fine–but nearly 40 percent of Americans will experience at least one year of poverty at some point in their life–40 percent. Think about that. So it’s not an issue that just impacts a few and it’s not an issue that we can ignore. So to tackle the problem of poverty, we need to understand all the complications. We’ve got to examine root causes, like the legacy of racial discrimination that has held down the relative wealth of majority and minority populations.

I mean, just for a second, I have a bill in Congress right now to commemorate 400 years of African Americans in the United States. The first African Americans were brought–captured from a slave ship to Jamestown in 1619. The 400th anniversary will be in 2019. If you think about 400 years of African American history, and we can talk about other minority groups, but just 400 years of African American history divided into eight half centuries. For five of the eight half centuries that African Americans have been here, they were legally held as slaves and they were not entitled to be U.S. citizens even if they were born free–five of the eight half centuries. For two of the eight half centuries, African Americans could not be enslaved and they were entitled to be U.S. citizens, but they were also treated legally as second-class citizens in housing, in education, in voting, in public accommodations, in virtually every aspect of life.

It’s only been in the last one-eighth of the history of 400 years of African Americans here that they have been treated with legal equality. That’s not the same as social equality, but at least legal equality for only one-eighth of that entire history. And so needless to say, the differences in wealth between African American and majority communities are very significant when you look at how hard it was to accumulate wealth while being held in second-class status for so very, very long.
If you can’t–if you can’t describe it and name it and just be honest about the facts, you’re never going to be able to move beyond and try to find solutions. So you’ve got to look at root causes like racial discrimination and its legacy that still reaches into our community, underinvestment in communities, holes in the social safety net that are still too easy to fall through if you get hit with a sudden medical bill or an illness or an accident.

So let me tell you what Hillary and I plan to do to help our low-income Americans and the communities that have been left out or left behind–what we would like to do if we have the honor to serve and what we would like to do working in partnership with this community and others.

First, the entire progressive economic agenda that we have is aimed at creating more growth and fairness. So nearly every major priority in the first pillar of the three pillars of the campaign–an economy that works for all, not just for a few–will help families living in poverty. When we talk about making the largest investment in jobs since World War II, that will help more families climb out of poverty. When we talk about reducing barriers for those in the workforce by providing child care or paid family leave, equal pay for women, that will help more families climb out of poverty. When we talk about making sure Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again or renegotiating NAFTA or rejecting trade deals like TPP that won’t create more jobs or raise wages, or when we talk about having a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect low-income consumers from abusive loans, ultimately these economic pillars, which are broad in scope, will help families climb out of poverty too.

I’m proud of the progressive that we have, and I’m proud that Hillary hasn’t backed away from bold principled commitments that she made when she won a very fairly and vigorously contested Democratic primary against a great colleague and friend, Bernie Sanders. We are progressives who want to get things done, and we believe getting things done is good policy and good politics. So that’s the kind of campaign we’re running, and if we’re successful, that’s the kind of administration we’ll lead.

But I want to focus today not on the general policies that will help deal with poverty, but on the specific things. What are the parts of the agenda that are specifically targeted at addressing poverty? And I want to talk about three sort of pillars. Hillary and I are looking at a comprehensive approach. And the first pillar is we’ve got to raise incomes for working families and just put more money in people’s pockets, raising income for working families. And the second thing we do is we have to make sure every family has a safe and healthy home and neighborhood, because that’s the foundation for economic success. And finally, we’ve got to make sure that all our kids have the education and skills they need to get ahead and provide for their own families one day. That’s how we’re going to break the grip of generational poverty, and all of this is achievable and all of this is affordable. And it shouldn’t be too much to ask for the wealthiest nation on earth.

So let’s start. Let’s start with pillar one. Let’s start with pillar one. How can we create jobs and get incomes rising in communities that have been left behind? One of the big problems in low-income neighborhoods is underinvestment. Focus: HOPE is not just the building we’re in. Focus: HOPE has taken 100 square blocks in this neighborhood and has programs like tentacles reaching everywhere, whether it’s food service for seniors or pre-K education or entrepreneurship training or the workforce training right here. We’ve got to invest in communities that have been underinvested.

We’re inspired by ideas here. We’re inspired by programs like the New Markets Tax Credit to help neighborhoods all over the country. Congressman Jim Clyburn has a proposal many of you know about–the 10-20-30 plan. It would direct 10 percent of federal investments to communities where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years. Why not focus–sometimes we run into a problem in legislative politics where you take what you do and you kind of spread it so thin over everywhere that you don’t get the bang for the buck. Let’s focus our energy and try to get bang for the buck in the communities that have most need. As mayor of Richmond, I worked on similar strategies to target our public investment in hard-hit neighborhoods so that they could see the most dramatic improvement. And we ought to do the same thing on a national level.

Our plan to make historic investment in jobs, especially around infrastructure and manufacturing and research, will provide funding for cities like Detroit to make desperately needed infrastructure repairs. Why don’t we put people to work building the road, rail, airport, port, public transit, broadband, and clean energy infrastructure of tomorrow? Interest rates are low; it’s the perfect time to do it. And we know on the infrastructure side this is something that the Chamber of Commerce loves every bit as much as organized labor loves it, and mayors and governors, Republican and Democrat, will be there advocating for it because they know the need is there. So these investments in jobs will be the core, and we’re going to do this in the first 100 days–put a bold proposal down before Congress and say, ‘Let’s do something good and then let’s fight about who should get credit for it rather than not do anything and fight about who to be blamed when nothing happens.’

Second, in this–in the jobs and in the area of jobs and wages, it is important to kind of know where jobs come from, right? They aren’t created by magic. Hillary and I come from small business families. Small businesses in this country create two-thirds of new jobs–two-thirds of new jobs. And so if you want more jobs, I mean, let’s go to the place where jobs come from, and that’s small businesses and our startups. We want to make it easier for small businesses to start in our communities, especially communities that need it most–minority and women-owned small businesses. The great thing about small businesses that isn’t always the case about the bigger businesses is that small business is just connected to the community. They’re going to be engaged in the philanthropies. They’re going to be engaged in the community activities and street fairs. Sometimes the biggest companies, they don’t have the loyalty necessarily to every neighborhood, but a small business is connected to the community where they are created.

Your mayor has launched programs like Motor City Match. We talked about it on the phone. Really excited to accelerate and–accelerate the ability of smart, innovative entrepreneurs to put their ideas into action. You’ve got a quarterly competition where people compete to get dollars to help them succeed. And those who don’t win the competition, hey, they get mentored and helped so maybe they’ll win the next quarter’s competition.

Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.

Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I’ve known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.

I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.

You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.

You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that’s really what this election is all about. It’s not about the noise and the distractions. It’s about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.

I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.

Now, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it’s really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there’s this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That’s a really good question. But I want you to know – look, I’ve said repeatedly I made a mistake, I’m not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn’t even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They’re looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?

Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am – I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he’s done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn’t understand why we can’t use nuclear weapons. He actually said, “Then why are we making them?” He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He’s mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn’t need to consult because, and I quote, “I have a very good brain.” He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don’t. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.

So in these last days, let’s not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.

I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It’s not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I’ve had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that’s why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.

I will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it’s hopeful and inclusive. It’s big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It’s a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we’re only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.

When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I’m not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.

And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn’t seem to bother him. “Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,” is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, “not have his finger on the button.” And when it comes to handling a crisis, we’ve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when he’s gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he’s challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he’s confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of “No!”] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you’ll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.

And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It’s an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we’ve seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I’ve had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.

But here’s what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can’t go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.

Oh my god. Hello Dade City! How are you? It’s a big pleasure for me and a great honor to be here with all of you. My name is Alicia Machado. Es un honor estar aquí con ustedes hoy en día. I was at home with my mom and my daughter, watching the first presidential debate when I was absolutely surprised to hear Hillary Clinton say my name. It was such an honor. During the debate, Hillary said about me, and I quote, ‘She has become a US citizen and you can bet that she is going to vote this November.’ Well, she’s right. Like — thank you! Okay, I lost my speech.

Like, all of you, I’m excited to be voting in this election. And you know what? I could not be prouder to cast my first presidential vote for Hillary Clinton.

Estoy muy orgullosa, muy orgullosa por votar por primera vez en este gran país y votar por Hillary Clinton. I was the first Miss Universe after Trump bought the pageant. It was such a gift and honor to represent my country Venezuela and to be Miss Universe 1996. But I was only 18 years old, a little girl with 18 years old and there was still so much that I didn’t know. Trump was overwhelming. I was scared of him. He made fun of me and I didn’t know how to respond. He told me that I looked ugly and I was massive. He even called me names. He said to me: ‘Miss Piggy, Miss Housekeeping, Miss Eating Machine.’ Soon, soon, it became a joke. Alicia Machado was the fat Miss Universe. It was really painful for me. It was cruel. For years afterwards I was sick, fighting back eating disorders.

Yo solo tenía diez y ocho años. Le tenía mucho miedo. Siempre fue muy agresivo y cruel conmigo. Y constantemente se burlaba de mi, llamandome con calificativo para ser me sentir mal, para ridiculisarme delante de la gente con sus bromas de Miss Piggy y de Miss Housekeeping. Se burlama de mí, me decía que era la Miss Gorda, la Miss Fea. Eso me hizo mucho daño. Por muchos anos despues sufrí de desórdenes alimenticios y de problemas de autoestima.

It’s clear, it’s really clear that he does not respect women. He just judges us on our looks. He thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it. Well, now I’m standing here on behalf of women and Latinos across the country. Americans who have been horrified with his dangerous ideas and vision of America. And together we are going to say loudly and clearly, ‘No Trump.’ He’s not getting away with it.

Hillary has been fighting for women, children and Latinas. Just average people like me and you her entire life. When she was still a student she traveled across Texas to register Latino voters to make sure that they could make their voices heard. When she was first lady, she organized the first ever White House conference on Hispanic children. She fought for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Those are just a few reasons why I support Hillary Clinton. She’s going to fight to fix our broken immigration system to families can stay together and everyone can take part in the American dream.

That is important to me and so many other people in Florida. She’s going to make sure that women finally get equal pay for their work. And she’s going to work to make jobs better for their families so everyone can be a good worker and a good parent. I’ve been talking to voters, signing up volunteers and making calls like me can see here today, there is so much enthusiasm for Hillary across the state. So to my fellow Floridians who have the right to vote, vote early, vote today. And to all the Latinos, this is our election. This is our election Latinos. Y nuestro voto es nuestra fuerza. Es nuestro poder. Así que vamos todos, vamos todos temprano a votar. Let’s work our heart out so that we can finally say madam president, señora presidenta on November 8th. Now, it’s my really honor and my pleasure to introduce the next president of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton.

HILLARY CLINTON:

Hello, Dade City!

I am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I’m also delighted that we’re joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.

I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!

It’s almost hard to believe, isn’t it? There are only seven days left in this election.

So are you ready to vote?

Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?

I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who’s been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he’s never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.

Now somebody asked me the other day, ‘Why do you keep coming back to Florida?’ Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it’s also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what’s at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.

One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don’t think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.

Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.

When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, ‘Well then why are we making them?’

And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear. Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, ‘We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.’ And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.

So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.

So is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don’t think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can’t be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don’t think that’s right.

Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.

Or maybe for some of you, it’s what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, ‘Well, we can’t trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.’ Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, ‘The definition of a racist comment.’

And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.

And then let’s not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we’d all be asking ourselves, ‘Well, what does he have against President Obama?’ Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I’m reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.

And here’s what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, ‘Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.’ So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, ‘I alone can fix it,’ runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.

So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, ‘What have you been doing for 30 years?’ And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I’ve been a lawyer, and I’ve been a first lady, and I’ve been a senator, and I’ve been Secretary of State, and I’ve been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I’ve been a woman.

And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he’s been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I’ve got to tell you, some of what we’ve learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we’re going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we’re going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you’re above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.

But I can’t just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we’ve got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can’t just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don’t like to hear this. I don’t blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn’t want to hear it either, to be honest. But I’ve got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it’s not okay to insult people. It’s not okay.

And look at what he does. He calls women ‘ugly,’ ‘disgusting,’ ‘nasty’ all the time. He calls women ‘pigs,’ rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her ‘Miss Piggy.’ He called her ‘Miss Housekeeping’ because she’s a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, ‘This is somebody who likes to eat.’ Well, I have to say: who doesn’t like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?

But you’ve got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I’ll tell you who: a bully, that’s who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn’t get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.

But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you’ve got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.

Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I’m doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let’s be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don’t look right, they’re not thin enough, they don’t act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?

And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that’s there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she’d run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We’d talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don’t let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don’t want them to feel bad about themselves. And we’ve got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women.

In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they’re love, they’re cared for, they’re respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that’s what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?

So I know there’s work to be done. We can’t do it with just words alone. We’ve got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I’m not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come [inaudible] ‘What he said on that tape is what he did to me.’

And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn’t possibly have said those things because the women weren’t attractive enough to assault. ‘Look at her,’ he said about one woman. ‘I don’t think so.’ About another, he said, ‘She wouldn’t be my first choice.’

He’s also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he said he did that to ‘inspect’ them. That was his word – and he said, ‘I sort of get away with things like that.’ And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what he did to us.’ Now, as bad as that is, he didn’t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He’s also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.

We cannot hide from this. We’ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump’s words have shaken her to her core.

For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that’s brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it’s been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as ‘locker room talk,’ well, I’ll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, ‘Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.’

Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.

And I don’t think there’s a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like.

He doesn’t look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.

Well, he’s very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn’t believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won’t raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.

Well, I have a message for him. We’re going to fight for affordable childcare. We’re going to fight for equal pay for all people. We’re going to fight for paid family leave, we’re going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that’s important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that’s especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we’ve got work to do my friends. I’m excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump’s dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.

But I can’t do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald’s name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!

Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.

In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes’ drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.

And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.

Don’t wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.

Donald Trump’s strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.

Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump’s economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.

So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.

We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.

Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.

I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!

Thank you all.
